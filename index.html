               <h1 class="mn-cont">Simple Steps</h1>
             </div>

            <p class="spe">Reaching your weight loss goals can be a big challenge, regardless of how much weight you <br> want to lose.</p>

            <p class="spe-1">However, taking it one step at a time and making a few minor modifications to your diet and <br> lifestyle can make weight loss much more manageable.</p>

            <p class="spe-1">By making some small changes to your daily routine, you can safely lose up to 10 pounds (4.5 <br> kg) in just one month, hitting your weight loss goals quickly and easily.</p>
            <p class="spe-1">Here are 14 simple steps to drop 10 pounds in a single month.</p>
                         
            <h1 class="mn-conti">1. Do More Cardio</h1>
            <img class="img-1" src="image/exercise.png" >
            <p class="spe-1">Aerobic exercise — also known as cardio — is a type of physical activity that increases your <br> heart rate to burn more calories and strengthen your heart and lungs.</p>

            <p class="spe-1">Adding <a class="sp-color" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/cardio-vs-weights-for-weight-loss" target="Blank">cardo</a> to your routine is one of the most effective ways to quickly increase weight loss.</p>

           <p class="spe-1"> In fact, one study in 141 obese adults showed that combining 40 minutes of cardio three times <br> per week with a weight loss diet decreased body weight by 9% over a six-month period (1).</p>

           <p class="spe-1">Another 10-month study found that burning either 400 or 600 calories five times per week by <br> doing cardio <a class="sp-color"  href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-benefits-of-exercise" target="Blank">exercise</a> exercise resulted in an average weight loss of 8.6 pounds <br> (3.9 kg) and 11.5 pounds (5.2 kg), respectively (2).</p>

           <p class="spe-1-1">For best results, try to fit in at least 20-40 minutes of cardio daily — or about 150-300 minutes <br> per week (3).</p>

                <p class="spe-a">Cutting down on carbs is another simple way to improve the quality of your diet and <br> further weight loss.</p>

                <p class="spe-a">It's especially beneficial to decrease your intake of <a class="sp-color" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/why-refined-carbs-are-bad" target="Blank">refined carbs</a>,which are a type of <br> carbohydrate stripped of their nutrient and fiber content during processing.</p>

                <p class="spe-a">Not only are refined carbs high in calories and low in nutrients, they're absorbed quickly into <br> your bloodstream, causing blood sugar spikes and increased hunger.

                </p>

                <p class="spe-a">Studies show that a diet high in refined grains is associated with a higher body weight than a <br> diet rich in nutritious <a class="sp-color" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-benefits-of-whole-grains" target="Blank">whole grains</a> .</p>

                <p class="spe-a">One large study in 2,834 people also found that people who ate more refined grains had on <br> average more belly fat than those who ate more whole grains.</p>

                <p class="spe-a">For best results, swap out refined carbs like white bread, breakfast cereals and heavily <br> processed pre-packaged foods for whole-grain products like quinoa, oats, brown rice <br> and barley.</p>

          <p class="spe-a">Soda, juice and energy drinks are often loaded with sugar and extra calories that can <br> contribute to weight gain over time.</p>
       
          <p class="spe-a">Conversely, water can help keep you feeling full and temporarily boost metabolism to cut <br> calorie consumption and enhance weight loss.</p>

          <p class="spe-a">One study in 24 overweight and obese adults showed that drinking 16.9 fluid ounces (500 ml) <br> of water before a meal decreased the number of calories consumed by 13% compared to <br> a control group.</p>

          <p class="spe-a">Another small study in 14 people found that drinking 16.9 fluid ounces (500 ml) of water <br> increased metabolism by 30% after 30-40 minutes, slightly increasing the number of calories <br> burned for a short time.</p>

          <p class="spe-a">To bump up weight loss, cut out high-calorie, sweetened beverages and aim to drink 34-68 <br> fluid ounces (1-2 liters) of water throughout the day.</p>

          <p class="spe-a">In order to lose weight, you need to use more calories than you consume, either by decreasing <br> your calorie intake or increasing your daily physical activity.</p>
